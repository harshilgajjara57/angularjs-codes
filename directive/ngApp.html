<!-- directive : ngApp -->

<!-- Use this directive to auto-bootstrap an AngularJS application. The ngApp directive designates the root element of the application and is typically placed near the root element of the page - e.g. on the <body> or <html> tags.

    There are a few things to keep in mind when using ngApp:
    
    only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first ngApp found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using angular.bootstrap instead.
    AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
    Do not use a directive that uses transclusion on the same element as ngApp. This includes directives such as ngIf, ngInclude and ngView. Doing this misplaces the app $rootElement and the app's injector, causing animations to stop working and making the injector inaccessible from outside the app. -->
