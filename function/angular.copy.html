<!-- function : angular.copy -->

<!-- Creates a deep copy of source, which should be an object or an array. This functions is used internally, mostly in the change-detection code. It is not intended as an all-purpose copy function, and has several limitations (see below).

If no destination is supplied, a copy of the object or array is created.
If a destination is provided, all of its elements (for arrays) or properties (for objects) are deleted and then all elements/properties from the source are copied to it.
If source is not an object or array (inc. null and undefined), source is returned.
If source is identical to destination an exception will be thrown. -->

<!-- usage : angular.copy(source, [destination]); -->
